CrudGenerator
=============

Generates a CRUD-ready controller and model.

Example:

  script/generate crud thing

Will generate a Thing model (and associated migration) and a Things controller.
This generator assumes the use of simply_restful so don't forget to put something like:

  map.resource :thing

in your routes.rb.

Happy CRUDing!
