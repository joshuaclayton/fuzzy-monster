# Put this file in your config directory for further processing by the
# bootstrap script.
#
# Here's an example:
# In the filesystem section, all paths are relative to RAILS_ROOT.
# 
# add a sequence in the create section to create missing folders such as /log.
# add a sequence in the verify section to raise an exception if a folder is missing
# to let the user know that a very important folder is missing.
#
# In the gems section, specify the gems that the user needs to run the application. 
# The version of the gem needed can also be specified (see the documentation at rubygems.org 
# for the format of version strings).  
# 
# filesystem:
#   create:
#     - "log"

#     - "tmp/sockets"
#   verify:
#     - "public/images"
